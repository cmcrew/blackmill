					<h2>Biography</h2>
					<p>Blackmill started of producing music at the age of 8 when he received his first musical instrument for his birthday - an Acoustic Guitar which he still plays to this day so look out for future tracks in this genre. At the age of 15 he started producing trance and uploading them to youtube under the alias "Robert J.C" As Dubstep grew throughout 2010 Blackmill took a shine to this new genre. Blackmill was quickly producing his own version of Dubstep, Melodic Dubstep. It's been proven to be a hit after he remixed Ellie Gouldings "Your Song" which took off straight away. Blackmill has just released his debut album "Reach For Glory" which can be downloaded here: </p><br/>
					<h2>About Dubstep</h2>
					<p>Dubstep is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in South London, England, United Kingdom. The music website <a href="http://allmusic.com">Allmusic</a> has described its overall sound as "tightly coiled productions with overwhelming bass lines and reverberant drum patterns, clipped samples, and occasional vocals."
					<p>The earliest dubstep releases date back to 1998, and were usually featured as B-sides of 2-step garage single releases. These tracks were darker, more experimental remixes with less emphasis on vocals, and attempted to incorporate elements of breakbeat and drum and bass into 2-step. In 2001, this and other strains of dark garage music began to be showcased and promoted at London's night club Plastic People, at the "Forward" night, which went on to be considerably influential to the development of dubstep. The term "dubstep" in reference to a genre of music began to be used by around 2002 by labels such as Big Apple, Ammunition, and Tempa, by which time stylistic trends used in creating these remixes started to become more noticeable and distinct from 2-step and grime.</p>
