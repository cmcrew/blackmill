	<li>Use the HTML and CSS properties already covered</li>
	<li>Use several img elements per page, use one or more CSS background images per page</li>
	<li>Include at least one external link per page (e.g. Pitchfork review)</li>
	<li>Make sure pages link together</li>
	<li>Include at least one embedded Youtube or Vimeo video</li>
	<li>Include an embedded Google Map on the band's tour page</li>
</ul>
